### Installation ###
  * Install Code Composer Studio 8.3.1 (CCS)
      * Install TM4C12xARM Cortex-M4F-core-based MCUs for Product Families
  * Install Stellaris ICDI Drivers
  * TM4C123G LaunchPad Tiva C ARM Cortex-M4F MCU 32-Bit Embedded Evaluation Board
  
### Usage ###
Once you've installed all the necessary software and imported the project into CCS, plug in the board and turn it on. You can use PuTTy or the built-in terminal inside CCS to display the game interface. Upload the game onto the microcontroller and follow the prompts on the GUI to start the game.
